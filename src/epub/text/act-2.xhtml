Now come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there ‘ ’tis; here’s my mother’s breath up and down. Now come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.</td>
