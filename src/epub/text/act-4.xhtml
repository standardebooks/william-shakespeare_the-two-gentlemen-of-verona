I have taught him, even as one would say precisely, “thus I would teach a dog.” I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon’s leg: O, ’tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have, as one should say, one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been hanged for’t; sure as I live, he had suffered for’t; you shall judge. He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentlemanlike dogs under the duke’s table: he had not been there⁠—bless the mark!⁠—a pissing while, but all the chamber smelt him. “Out with the dog!” says one: “What cur is that?” says another: “Whip him out” says the third: “Hang him up” says the duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs: “Friend,” quoth I, “you mean to whip the dog?” “Ay, marry, do I,” quoth he. “You do him the more wrong,” quoth I; “ ’twas I did the thing you wot of.” He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay, I’ll be sworn, I have sat in the stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for’t. Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman’s farthingale? didst thou ever see me do such a trick?</td>

									<span>Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Ay, but her forehead’s low, and mine’s as high.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>What should it be that he respects in her</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But I can make respective in myself,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If this fond Love were not a blinded god?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For ’tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou shalt be worshipp’d, kiss’d, loved and adored!</span>
									<br/>

									<span>My substance should be statue in thy stead.</span>

									<span>I’ll use thee kindly for thy mistress’ sake,</span>
